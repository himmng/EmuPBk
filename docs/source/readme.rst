Epoch of Reionization(EoR) is one of the least known and yet important period
in the history of the Universe. The very first structures(Stars, Galaxies) are supposed to
form during this era. The 21-cm Powerspectrum and Bispectrum statistics
puts great possibility to probe the EoR. So, we have developed two different ANN based 21-cm statistical signal emulators (21-cm Powerspectrum and Bispectrum emulator) based on Supervised machine learning
(Artificial Neural Network).
This module contains some trained ANN models from over 1000 simulated Powerspectrum and Bispectrum given the 3 EoR parameters(Nion,Rmfp,Mhmin)- The ionizing efficiency, Mean free path of
ionizing photons(The size of the ionized region) & Minimum halo mass of the ionized region.
We used a C-based semi-numarical code `ReionYuga <https://github.com/rajeshmondal18/ReionYuga>`_
to build the data-sets for training and testing our ANNs.

However, the structure of ANNs' are such, that anyone can build their own ANN model from their own datasets.
This module also simplifies MCMC analysis and posterior visualization.

All ANNs' related tasks were done using `keras <https://keras.io/>`_, a python based deeplearning library,
For MCMC analysis we used python `cosmoHammer <http://cosmo-docs.phys.ethz.ch/cosmoHammer/>`_, which uses 
`emcee <https://emcee.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_
and for plotting and visualization we used `chainconsumer <https://samreay.github.io/ChainConsumer/>`_
