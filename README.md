# PkANN
21-cm powerspectrum emulator based on Artificial Neural Network, it is trained over 1065 simulated powerspectrums for a wide EoR parameter ranges at a redshift (z) of 9.210. It capable of reproducing the 21-cm powerspectrums with more than 98% accuracy compared to simulated 21-cm powerspectrum.
