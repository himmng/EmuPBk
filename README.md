# EmuPBk
21-cm powerspectrum emulator based on Artificial Neural Network, It is trained over 1065 simulated powerspectrums for a 
wide EoR parameter ranges at a redshift (z) of 9.210. It capable of reproducing the 21-cm powerspectrums with more than 
98% accuracy compared to simulated 21-cm powerspectrum.

* These emulated 21-cm powerspectrum signals then can be used as a theoretical model for MCMC analysis, replacing the
 time consuming EoR simulations.
